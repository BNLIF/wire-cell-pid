Let me compare the M2_check_tgm() and check_tgm() functions to identify the key differences:

1. Input Parameters:
- check_tgm() takes: (PR3DCluster*, Opflash*, double offset_x, ToyCTPointCloud&)
- M2_check_tgm() takes: (PR3DCluster*, double offset_x, ToyCTPointCloud&)

The main difference is that M2_check_tgm() doesn't require an Opflash* parameter, suggesting it can work without flash information.

2. Core Logic:
Both functions share very similar core logic and structure:
- Get extreme points from the cluster
- Check fiducial volume boundaries
- Perform angular checks with drift direction and wire plane directions 
- Check signal processing and dead volume regions
- Check distance and angle criteria for through-going muon identification

3. Key Differences:
a) Main parameter comparison - M2_check_tgm() removes flash dependency allowing it to identify through-going muons without requiring flash information

b) Code logic differences:
- Identical checks for:
  - Fiducial volume boundaries
  - Signal processing
  - Dead volume regions 
  - Angle measurements with drift and wire plane directions
  - Distance criteria between points

c) No significant additional functionality:
- The M2_check_tgm() appears to be a simplified version that removes flash dependency while maintaining the same core TGM (through-going muon) identification logic
- All the geometric and physics-based checks remain identical between both functions
- The only real difference is the removal of flash-based checks and criteria

In summary, M2_check_tgm() appears to be an adaptation of check_tgm() that removes the flash dependency while maintaining all the same geometric and physics-based TGM identification capabilities. This allows for TGM identification even in cases where flash information may not be available or reliable, making it more flexible but potentially less constrained in its identification criteria since it cannot use timing information from the flash.

The code suggests this was likely done to allow TGM identification in scenarios where flash matching is poor or unavailable, while maintaining the core geometric identification capabilities of the original algorithm.
