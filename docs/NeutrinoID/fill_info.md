I'll create a markdown overview of these functions from the NeutrinoID class:

# NeutrinoID Function Overview

### fill_fit_parameters()
- Organizes vertex and segment information for clusters 
- Sets fit parameters for all clusters in the reconstruction
- Updates point sub-cluster IDs and flags across clusters

### fill_reco_tree()
- Fills reconstruction tree information for individual segments and showers
- Stores particle tracks, momentum, energy, directionality and other kinematic information 
- Two overloaded versions - one for ProtoSegments and one for WCShowers

### fill_pi0_reco_tree()  
- Specialized function for π⁰ reconstruction
- Records π⁰ decay products and kinematics
- Tracks parent-child relationships between particles
- Returns identification info for the reconstructed π⁰

### fill_psuedo_reco_tree()
- Creates and fills "pseudo" particle entries in reconstruction tree
- Used for particles that are inferred but not directly reconstructed
- Handles both photons and neutrons
- Returns an ID for the created pseudo particle

### fill_reco_simple_tree()
- Simplified version of reconstruction tree filling
- Only processes main cluster information
- Records basic track/segment information without complex relationships

### fill_particle_tree()
- Comprehensive particle hierarchy reconstruction
- Establishes parent-child relationships between particles
- Handles both directly reconstructed and inferred particles
- Tracks particle interactions and decays

[find_incoming_segment](./find_incoming_segment.md)

### fill_proto_main_tree()
- Similar to fill_reco_simple_tree but focuses on proto-vertices
- Maps relationships between segments in the main cluster
- Establishes particle hierarchy within main cluster

### fill_skeleton_info_magnify()
- Detailed geometric reconstruction information
- Enhanced version of skeleton info with additional detail
- Handles both vertex and segment information
- Includes charge/energy deposit information

### fill_skeleton_info()
- Basic geometric reconstruction information
- Records vertex and segment positions
- Tracks charge deposits and path information
- Base version without magnification

### fill_point_info()
- Records individual 3D points in reconstruction
- Associates points with clusters and segments
- Tracks shower vs track classification for points

### init_tagger_info()
- Initializes all particle identification flags and variables
- Sets up cosmic ray tagging parameters
- Initializes neutrino interaction classification variables
- Prepares shower/track discrimination parameters
- Sets up π⁰ reconstruction variables

These functions collectively handle the full reconstruction chain, from basic geometric information to complex particle hierarchies and interactions, while maintaining classification and identification information throughout the process.
